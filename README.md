**Bank Loan Dashboard â€“ Tableau**

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard for analyzing bank loan applications and performance. I independently designed and built dashboards to visualize key lending metrics and borrower profiles.

**Project Overview**

The dashboard provides an end-to-end view of loan data, helping to evaluate lending decisions, borrower profiles, and funding patterns. It consolidates KPIs and visual insights into three dashboards:

**1.Summary Dashboard**

Displays overall KPIs such as total loan applications, total funded amount, average interest rate, and the proportion of good vs. bad loans.

Offers a high-level snapshot of overall lending performance.

**2.Overview Dashboard**

Shows breakdowns of loans by purpose, term (36 / 60 months), employee length, home ownership, and state distribution.

Helps identify patterns in borrower demographics and loan performance.

**3.Details Dashboard**

Provides a tabular drill-down to view individual loan records.

Useful for deeper analysis and validation.
